# Claire Offboarding Challenge:

Claire is leaving JET and is very sad. She has one problem though:
As part of offboarding, she needs to organise all her demos and they are an absolute mess!

<img src='./Screenshot 2025-08-22 at 10.43.05.png'>

She has been taking screenshots of features without naming them properly, so all the demos are called `"Screenshot XXXX-XX-XX at XX.XX.XX.png` or `"Screenrecording XXXX-XX-XX at XX.XX.XX.mov"`.

Given a representation of the file names, can you help her sort them by:

- Arranging the screenshots and screenrecordings **in a grid** where:
  - Each row represents a 1-month period
  - all `.mov` files go before `.png` files
- **Rename each file** by getting the sum of the **hour of each of its neighbours**, then converting that number to its associated ASCII character
- Don't worry if you have files with the same name. This is expected!
